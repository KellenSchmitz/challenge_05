Matplotlib and Pandas

##  Overview
The CEO has asked us to review and summarize the ride-sharing data by city type in order to allocate resources and investigate new areas for improvement. 


## Results
From the table below, we can see that urban cities have the highest number of rides and produce the most revenue. However, it is notable that suburban and rural rides have higher average fares per ride.

We can clearly see that urban rides contribute most to revenue for the chart below.

## Summary
We would suggest that PyBer look for ways to increase the number of rides in suburban ares, which could contribute to higher profitability.
